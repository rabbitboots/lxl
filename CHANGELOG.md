# v2.0.4 -- 07 Oct 2024

* Renamed files:
  * Library files beginning with `xml` now start with `lxl`
  * Renamed test files to be more descriptive.
* Flattened the `test` folder.
* Moved library files out of `xml_lib` and into the main directory.
* Integrated snippets from PILE (type checker, etc.).
* Replaced `utf8_tools.lua` with `pile_utf8.lua` and `utf8_conv.lua` with `pile_utf8_conv.lua`.
* Gathered license text for test libraries into the file `test_LICENSE`.


# v2.0.3 -- 01 Oct 2024

* Updated license text to include the copyright for code from kikito/utf8_validator.lua (in xml_shared.lua).


# v2.0.2 -- 06 Sept 2024

* Added `Parser:setCheckCharacters()` and `Parser:getCheckCharacters()`.
* Modified `shared.checkXMLCharacters()` to include logic based on [kikito's utf8_validator.lua](https://github.com/kikito/utf8_validator.lua). (See also utf8Tools, where the code is imported as `utf8Tools.checkAlt()`.) This pattern-based code is faster when run under PUC-Lua.
* Updated libraries: errTest (2.1.1 -> 2.1.2), utf8Tools (1.3.0 -> 1.4.0)
* Simplified the layout of code point lookup tables in xmlShared.

# v2.0.1 -- 08 Jul 2024

* Added xml.load()


# v2.0.0 -- 05 Jul 2024

This is a major rewrite of [xmlToTable](https://github.com/rabbitboots/xml_to_table). Unfortunately, there are so many changes that it's not possible to write a straightforward upgrade guide. The main improvements are:

* UTF-16 support (internal conversion to UTF-8)
* Parsing of DOCTYPE tags and the DTD internal subset (in a non-validating manner)
* More conformant handling of whitespace
* Serialization has been promoted from "for debugging purposes" to an official feature
* Attribute order is discarded; duplicate attributes are not allowed at all. It was a mistake to order attributes in the first place.
* XML Declarations are now handled
* Support for `xml:space="preserve"` when pruning whitespace
* Some support for XML Namespaces 1.0 and 1.1
